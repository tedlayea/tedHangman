To devlop this game, HTML,CSS, Javascript and jQuery are used.
In addition to these Adobe Photoshop and paint also used to prepare images for animation.
The approach used in this game devlopment is step by step incremental way in which different parts of the game dvloped and testd before further continuing other parts of the game.
At this stage, only the basic functionality are working. But in future I would like to include the following modification:
1. Score point will be half if the player uses hint.
2. Store the players history and top scores.
3. Consider different browser and mobile in order to display the game properly.
4. Take more than one value from keyboard , store and compare the result
5. To add option to player for two player

Included but unsolved problems:
1. Restart button doesn`t restart the game properly
2. The game is not closed when user want to quit.

AM: Look into using Markdown for your readme. It helps a lot with styling (and it's what we use in our lesson plans!).
